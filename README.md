It is a simple python script to protect pdfs. 
***Syntax*** python3 script.py <input_pdf> <output_pdf> <password>
Make sure that the pdf you want to protect is on the same place as the python script, otherwise it may not work. Also, It will make a new copy of the file but password protected, so make sure to add *.pdf* extension at the end of copy file name. Otherwise it may create a file according to the extension.
Works best in VS code
